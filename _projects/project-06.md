title: "Efficient Model for Navigation"
excerpt: "Developed a high-performance vision pipeline to help autonomous robots navigate complex “wild” outdoor environments through advanced image segmentation. In Module 1: Machine Learning Model Development, I designed and optimized three complementary model families: DeepLabV3 for robust semantic segmentation, Vision–Language Models (VLMs) for open-vocabulary scene understanding, and SAM-Adapter foundation models for high-precision, detail-preserving perception. To support real-time robotics deployment, I built the PyTorch-to-ONNX conversion workflow and worked closely with the team to integrate and serve the models via NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, balancing segmentation accuracy with low-latency, resource-efficient execution so robots can perceive and react to unpredictable terrain more effectively. <br/><img src='/images/EM_Model.png' style='margin-top: 15px;'>"
