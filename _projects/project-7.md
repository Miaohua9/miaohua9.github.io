title: "AI for Precision Agriculture"
excerpt: >
  This project is supported by the Griffith–CSIRO R+ PhD Scholarship Program and focuses on plant disease detection using self-supervised learning and Vision Mamba architectures, which are well-suited for modeling long-range dependencies in leaf structures.

  To date, we have developed three frameworks:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ConMamba</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03213">arXiv:2506.03213</a></li>
    <li><strong>PSMamba</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03693">arXiv:2506.03693</a></li>
    <li><strong>StateSpace-SSL</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04681">arXiv:2506.04681</a></li>
  </ul>
  These models aim to support early disease detection in low-label agricultural settings through scalable, high-resolution visual understanding.
