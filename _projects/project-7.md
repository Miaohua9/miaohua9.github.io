title: "Robust Machine Learning for Noisy and Incomplete Data"
excerpt: >
  This work focused on developing robust machine learning algorithms to address challenges arising from noisy, incomplete, or corrupted data. I designed models based on low-rank regression, tensor factorization, and sparse representation to improve stability and accuracy under data degradation. To further enhance robustness, I introduced adaptive weighting and regularization strategies that automatically downweight abnormal or outlier samples during training, leading to improved predictive performance and model interpretability. These approaches are particularly valuable in real-world scenarios where data quality is inconsistent or labels are unreliable.
