title: "AI for precision agriculture"
excerpt: "This project is under support of Griffith-CSIRO R+ PhD scholarship program. It explores plant disease detection using self-supervised learning and Vision Mamba architectures, which are well-suited for modeling long-range dependencies in leaf structures. Unitl now, we generate three works: Conmamba, which combines a bidirectional state-space encoder with dual-level contrastive loss for robust local–global feature alignment; PSMamba, which introduces a shared teacher with two specialized student branches to capture multi-scale lesion characteristics; and StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time model that leverages directional scanning to capture lesion continuity across leaf surfaces. These models aim to support early disease detection in low-label agricultural settings through scalable, high-resolution visual understanding. <br/><img src='/images/plant_disease.png' style='margin-top: 15px;'>"
