title: "Generative AI (Deep Scene Understanding for Robotics Navigation via Mask-Conditioned Generative AI)"
excerpt: "Developed a conditional diffusion–based data augmentation framework for marine obstacle
detection, aimed at improving segmentation robustness under visually challenging conditions. The pipeline
combines a class-aware style bank to generates high-entropy, semantically grounded prompts with an
adaptive annealing sampler that perturbs early conditioning. A guided controller further regulates this
perturbation to enhance diversity while preserving layout fidelity. The resulting synthetic images are
layout-aligned and semantically varied, improving generalization performance in downstream segmentation
tasks, particularly for rare or texture-sensitive classes.<br/><img src='/images/navigation.png' style='margin-top: 15px;'>"
